-   Firstly, we have to "Select samples". Samples are collected from 104 countries - 565 censuses and surveys with over 1 billion person records. Samples are listed in order from A-Z. Then, we could choose the country and the year we need.

Samples are categorized by continents such as Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe. They are also filtered by historical and survey options.

Click "Submit Extract" when finishing requests.
